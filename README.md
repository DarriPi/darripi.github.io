## October 12 
* I added the music player but I need to fix the volume button
* Also need to fix z-index issues
* Finally need to adjust size of music player
* Need to make it so user can ONLY drag div from the header

Currently working on the wallpaper selector. Want it more visually pleasing and then add a exit button on the top right corner of the wallpaper selector.
So in short I have the following things to do.
* Add exit button to wallpaper selector
* Make it so when the user clicks the desktop item again. It says something like the "Proceess is already open"
* Finally need to find out how to make the different apps so to say stay in the save viewport and not go beyond it.

# 03 December 2025 ISSUE I RAN INTO (TODO)
When I try to move the reusable code to a utils.js file the apps do not work anymore.
NEED TO FIX that

# 08 December 2025 (Some code consistency issued)
I ran into some code consistency issues. Especially the draglement code.
When appending the header it did not really get into detail there. 
NEED TO FIX THAT
* Need to test and see if email gets through in when submitting the form

# 10 December 2025 TODO
Just struck me that I need to list my experience as well.
Will do that in the console app where the user can type in the following
'ls experience' or 'ls projects'
